#### UI for Anchor

Trying to figure out how to call Anchor programs with a graphiql thing.

1. `npm run dev` to bring the server up
2. `http://localhost:4000` to get the apollo studio.

- [x] Get the IDL displayed
- [ ] Make calls of instructions from the grapphiql explorer
- [ ] Pass required parameters to the instruction call
- [ ] Figure out more stuf...
